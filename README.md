[Coingecko API doc](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation): to get cyptocurrencies daily historical market capitalization dataset since 2018 till 2021.

# Step by step through data obtention üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Get prices:
    - Download csv files from web into "data" folder, clean names and rename them (one file per coin)
    - In order to unify data, loop by list names and concatenate all coins data into one dataframe

2. Get marketcap:
    - Connect to API, provide parameters and export json files (one per coin)
    - In order to unify data, loop by list names and concatenate all coins data into one dataframe

3. Merge databases by coin/date (cleaning, filling missings and filtering data)

4. Dictionary creation to perform queries

    - Semesterly price candles (max, min, close)
    - Monthly marketcap
    - Circulating supply effect after last btc halving event

2. bullish_or_bearish: given a certain list of coins and date range, plot the accumulated gain/(loss) from each asset (funny fact: in the list of coins i selected during 2021, non of them gained less than 50% in that year - of course none of them reported loss)

3. market_cake: top 10 cryptocurrencies pie chart by their market value

    - SAND/MANA marketcap and price comparasion
    - How Facebook's name change announcement affected these coins market value

    - Daily luna/ust price chart
    - Daily luna/ust circulating supply chart

# Files structure üì¶

1. data folder: csv/json files used

2. notebooks folder: 
    - api
    - data_cleaning
    - exploratory

2. scr folder: folder where all the .py files are stored with all the explained functions used during the whole project.The .py files included are: 
    - 
    - 
    - 

3. Output: all output files.
