# Objetive
The objective of this project is to determine the perfect location for a new company in the gaming industry. 

- **Designers** --> near to companies that do design.
- **30% of the company** --> have at least 1 child.
- **Developers** --> to be near tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- **Executives** --> like Starbucks.
- **Account managers** --> travel a lot.
- **Average age between 25 and 40** -->some place to go party.
- **CEO** --> vegan.
- **Maintenance guy** --> basketball court
- **Dog—"Dobby"** --> hairdresser every month. 

Based on all the information given by the employees, the first filters I applied to look for possible locations were:
 1. Spanish companies.
 2. In the web sector to be surrounded by companies that are in a similar sector to ours.
 3. With less than 50 employees, to be surrounded by small companies like us
 4. Created since 2007 to be surrounded by young companies. 

# Working plan 

![workingflow](https://github.com/AnaAGG/P3_Geospatial_Data/blob/main/Images/Work_Flow.jpg)

Before first filtering using MongoDB I obtained a set of XXX companies with coordinates located in **Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Gijón**. 

The coordinates were used to realice the API Foursquare calls using Bars, Preschool, Court Basketball, vegan restaurants and train stations. 

Once all the information was downloaded in json format, I made a calculation of the distances between the coordinates of origin and the information obtained from Foursquare. 

For the final decision of the location I have made a normalisation and assigned weights to the distances obtained. In the end, a ranking was obtained on which the final decision was based. 

The following resources have been used to achieve the objective of this project: 

-  [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/): get access to global data and  content from thousands trusted sources. To access all the necessary information about the resources surrounding the possible locations of the enterprise. 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that we want using querying and indexing.


### Structure of the project files

The structure of this project is composed of:
 1. A folder of notebooks: 
    
    a) **Explore_Companies.ipynb** -->with the preliminary analysis where I search for companies that meet the requirements established a priori to be able to pre-select locations. 

    b) **APIs.ipynb** --> the call is made to the Api of "Foursquare Developers", where we will get some preferred conditions where we want our company to be located. 

    c) **Geospatial queries.ipynb** --> we make the spatial queries to calculate the distance between each point obtained in the Foursquare API and the locations selected at the beginning.

    d) **Madrid vs Barcelona vs Bilbao vs Gijon.ipynb** --> the relationship between each selected parameter (train stations, bars, vegan restaurants, basketball courts, and children's schools) and the possible locations (Madrid, Barcelona, Gijon and Bilbao) is evaluated. For this purpose, a normalisation and categorisation has been used. 

 2. scr folder: folder where all the .py files are stored with all the explained functions used during the whole project. The .py files included are: 
    a) APIsFunctions used in the APIs.ipynb
    b) GeospatialFunctions used in the Gespatial queries.ipynb
    c) CleaningFunctions used in the Madrid vs Barcelona vs Bilbao vs Gijon.ipynb

 3. Output: all the dataframes imported and saved in csv format.
